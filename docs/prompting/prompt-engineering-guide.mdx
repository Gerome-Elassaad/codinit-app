## Prompting Best Practices

Crafting effective prompts helps Codinit.dev generate projects that match your exact vision.  
This guide walks you through how to **be specific about your stack** and how to **leverage the Prompt Enhancer** for optimal results.

---

## Be Specific About Your Stack

Codinit’s AI understands context, but it works best when you **clearly define your tech stack**.  
If you specify which frameworks, libraries, or tools you prefer, Codinit will scaffold the project with the right configurations out of the box.

<Info>
If you don’t specify your stack, Codinit defaults to modern web standards — usually a JavaScript framework like React with minimal styling.
</Info>

### Example

```markdown
Build me a portfolio website using Astro, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI.  
Include a responsive navbar, project cards, and a contact form.
````

This ensures that:

* **Astro** handles static site generation.
* **TailwindCSS** manages styling.
* **ShadCN UI** provides elegant, prebuilt UI components.

### Supported Stacks

You can freely mix and match stacks. Here are some supported combinations:

| Category                   | Examples                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend Frameworks**    | React, Next.js, Astro, Vue, Svelte          |
| **Styling / UI Libraries** | TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Chakra UI, Material UI |
| **Backend / API**          | Express, Supabase, Firebase                 |
| **Animations / Effects**   | Framer Motion, GSAP                         |

<Note>
When specifying your stack, include versions or preferences if needed:  
> “Generate a Next.js 15 app using TailwindCSS v4 and ShadCN components.”
</Note>

## Using the Prompt Enhancer

The **Prompt Enhancer** is your built-in AI assistant for refining your instructions before submission.

Click the **Enhance** icon next to the prompt input field to automatically improve your request.

### How It Works

1. **You start with an idea**

   > “Make me a dashboard.”

2. **Click “Enhance”**
   The AI rewrites it into a clearer, more actionable version:

   > “Create a responsive analytics dashboard using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Chart.js.
   > Include user login, light/dark mode, and sample data charts.”

3. **You review and edit**
   You can adjust frameworks, add details, or remove anything unnecessary.

4. **Submit the enhanced prompt**
   Once it’s clear and complete, hit **Generate** to scaffold your project.

### Why Use the Enhancer

| Benefit         | Description                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clarity**     | Ensures your idea is expressed in a way the AI fully understands   |
| **Specificity** | Adds stack details, dependencies, and best practices automatically |
| **Speed**       | Reduces back-and-forth revisions after generation                  |
| **Control**     | You can edit before submission — the final say is always yours     |

<Tip>
The Prompt Enhancer won’t lock your stack — it suggests improvements but lets you **retain control** over every word.
</Tip>

## Best Practices Checklist

<Steps>
<Step title="Define your goal clearly">
Describe what you want Codinit to build — e.g., *a blog, dashboard, or landing page.*
</Step>

<Step title="Specify frameworks and libraries">
Mention frameworks like Astro, Next.js, or React, and tools like Tailwind or ShadCN.
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Enhance icon">
Click enhance button to refine your prompt for clarity and specificity.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit before submitting">
Review the enhanced prompt, customize as needed, and then submit.
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate if needed">
If the initial result isn’t perfect, re-prompt with added context or adjustments.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Example Workflow

<CodeBlock>

**Initial Prompt:**

> “Build a landing page for a startup.”

**Enhanced Prompt:**

> “Create a responsive SaaS landing page using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.
> Include a hero section, pricing table, and signup form integrated with Supabase.”

</CodeBlock>

The enhanced version gives Codinit a **precise blueprint** — resulting in a cleaner, production-ready scaffold.
